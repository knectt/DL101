    "### 1. What is a \"target variable? \n",
    "\n",
    "* A. It is similar to the y variable in an equation.\n",
    "* B. It informs the algorithm what to target during convolution data processing iterations.\n",
    "* C. It is the variable that our model seeks to predict.\n",
    "* D. It helps the algorithm decide how to split the data set\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Why do you need to split your dataset into training, validation and test sets?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A. The model can easily overfit on the training set, so validation and test are extra sets to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "* B. You train on the training set, you check the metrics on the validation set, you make the model predictions on the test set.\n",
    "* C. The validation set is used to check your assumptions before the model training, while the test set is used test the results of the model training.\n",
    "* D. The training set is required to train the baseline model, the validation set is used for model tuning, the test set is used to fine-tune the model until it achieves the state-of-the-art result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. After learning about AutoML, how would you approach machine learning tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A. AutoML is inherently dumb thing, because you have to use the neural network algorithm in the most of the times as its very powerful in making predictions on sophisticated data.\n",
    "* B. AutoML allows you to explore how several algorithms might fit the data in order to determine the most suitable one.\n",
    "* C. AutoML is only for non-ML professionals because ML engineers know exactly what methods and techniques will work just by looking at the data.\n",
    "* D. AutoML is not easy at all as you still need to code AutoML steps, have strong mathematical and machine learning skills \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Why would you cross validate the results of our training using many folds?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A.Splitting dataset to trainig/validation/test sets might not be enough as you might not have the same data distribution among all sets to confidentally determine ML model training results. \n",
    "* B.In case if you have a small dataset, you might have the validation set so small with only few examples of the particular class that will result in pure model evaluation\n",
    "* C. The similar model performance accross all folds might indicate that model will perform well on unseen data\n",
    "* D. Splitting the dataset randomly will not always result in randomness accross the trainining/validation/test sets"
